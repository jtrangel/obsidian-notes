Started with Google via **Google File System (GFS)**, **MapReduce (MR)**, and **Bigtable**. Continued with Yahoo via **Hadoop** which included the ff:

- Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)
- Hadoop Common
- MapReduce
- YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator)

Spark was made to address the ff. MapReduce issues:

- Low fault tolerance
- Large MR jobs (with MR tasks) wrote to disk after each MR task, so these could take hours or days just to run
- MR was not interactive. Had no capability for streaming, ML, and SQL querying. Band-aid fix was several tools like Hive, Impala, Drill, Storm, Mahout.
- MR was too complex, with steep learning curve.
## Spark

- Unified distributed computing engine, available for both on prem and cloud.
- Incorporated the ff. libraries:
	- Spark MLlib
	- Spark SQL
	- Structured Streaming
	- GraphX
