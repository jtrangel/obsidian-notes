Reading this book as a part of my growth in learning Big Data. Even though most people can dilute the content as simply using the DataFrame API or Spark SQL like Pandas/SQL, I find that some of the interesting parts of Big Data happens under the hood. 

Funny enough, I am starting to do heavier work on PySpark in Optus. Also have been getting external job opportunities that use PySpark heavily. 

Might also be useful for Databricks Data Engineering Professional Certification. Or maybe the Spark Developer certification. 

Regardless, this is a book I am heavily interested in. To the point that I made space for it, here in my second brain.
